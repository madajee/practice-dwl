## about
As a muley, I believe that we should allocate few hours a week to hone the dwl skills. I am taking an approach to generate an input based on a noun like customer and write dwl scripts that will states few different ways; an input file of generated input like customer.json will be transformed using dataweave capabilities. As an inital thought, I will generate another input based on another noun after creating 10 scripts in dwl_10 folder and repeat this same exercise in a dwl_20 folder.

## dwl_10

Check the learndwl_10.gist for description of different transformation tasks. Usage: map(), mapObject(), upper(), groupBy(), reduce(), filter(), isEmpty(), format as Number, format as Date, pluck(), joinBy()
